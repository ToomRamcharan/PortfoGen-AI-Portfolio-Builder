# 🚀 Quick Start Scripts

I've created easy-to-use scripts for Windows:

## 📦 INSTALL.bat
Double-click this file to:
- Check if Node.js is installed
- Install all required dependencies automatically
- Show helpful error messages if something goes wrong

## ▶️ START_SERVER.bat
Double-click this file to:
- Start the secure backend server
- Open on http://localhost:3000
- Keep the server running (don't close the window!)

## 🔄 Daily Usage

Once installed, you only need to:
1. Double-click `START_SERVER.bat`
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Node.js is not installed"
→ Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org and restart your computer

### "Dependencies not installed"
→ Run `INSTALL.bat` first

### "Port 3000 already in use"
→ Close other applications using port 3000, or edit `.env` to change the port
